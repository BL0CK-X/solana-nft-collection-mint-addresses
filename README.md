# Solana NFT Collection Mint Addresses

## About

This is a public repository containing the mint addresses of popular collections on Solana. Please add and help us expand this open source project.

This maps a collection name (e.g., `solana_money_boys`) to a list of mint addresses (e.g., `66MZJWWM7ucWay8R2BzYgZVQHo3X2ZviYvCi4BCr42u6`).

## How to Help

You can help by providing the list of mint addresses for other collections on Solana to the `collections.json` file.
